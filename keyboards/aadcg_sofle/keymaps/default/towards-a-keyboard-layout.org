* Thinking about the US keyboard layout.

The Sofle keyboard has 58 keys (29+29).

The keyboard must provide a mechanism to insert the letters of the
english alphabet (26) in both lower and upper case.  And the digits
of the decimal number system (10).

Besides there's RET, SPC (2).

There are some (randomly chosen) symbols namely the following 32:
` ~ * & ^ % ! @ # $ + = - _ ' " [ ] { } ( ) < > ; : . , ? / \ |

There are also non-printing characters.  Some of these are modifiers
keys.  Let change the meaning of the pressed key.  Their names doesn't
really matter, but these include Control, Meta/Alt, Shift, Super, Hyper,
etc.  And also TAB, ESC, Backspace, Delete.

There's also the concept of a layer.

A single keyboard key k can have the following behaviours:
- itself
- C-k
- M-k
- C-M-k
- Layer[n]-k
- Hold-k
- Shift-k
- Super-k
- more combinations between the modifier keys

Notice that when a key is chosen to perform a hold functionality it
becomes hard to repeat that key in both the tap and the hold
functionality.  For example, in Emacs C-n is pressed multiples times
while "a" is usually pressed once.

Control

| `~  |  9( | 8*  | 7&  | 6^  | 5%  |      |       | 0)  | 1!        | 2@        | 3#  | 4$  | =+ |
| '"  |     | C-w | C-e | C-r | C-t |      |       | C-y | C-u       | C-i = TAB | C-o | C-p | -_ |
| TAB | C-a | C-s | C-d | C-f | C-g |      |       | C-h | C-j       | C-k       | C-l | ;:  | BS |
| S(  |     | C-x | C-c | C-v | C-b | Mute | PrtSc | C-n | C-m = RET | ,<        | .>  | /?  | S) |
|-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+-------+-----+-----------+-----------+-----+-----+----|
|     |     | ESC | S   | L1  | SPC | RET  | SPC   | RET | L1        | AltGr     | \   |     |    |
|-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+-------+-----+-----------+-----------+-----+-----+----|

I could remap all motion keybindings to up, down, left, right, home,
end, pagedown and pageup.  Notice that could work with C-M-p/n f/b u/d
a/e.

That would require an additional layer with these keys.  It should be
chosen so that the behaviour matches other programs such has browsers.

* Mousekeys
Implement const velocity and acceleration.
Implement drag and drop.

Read Xorg specification.

Understand the difference between polled and interrupted (PS/2 and USB).
The former is USB and the CPU constantly checks for pressed keys.
Interrupts, on the other hand, interrupt the CPU when keys are pressed.
See [[https://cs.calvin.edu/activities/books/rit/chapter2/design/hardware/io/index.htm][this]].

Take a look at [[https://github.com/liyang/qmk_firmware/blob/develop/kinetic/quantum/mousekey.c][this]] alternative QMK implementation.
